<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

#### Design Architecture
`React native` to design the pages used in EduCube2.

#### Highlights

* One highlight was to `research`  golf the sport and it was a really popular sport.
* The `UI/UX design` was to help golfers to easily input scores and have companies host competitions.
* The best part was to load the app onto a `real device` and being able to have it on `android` and `IOS`.
* ` Creating` a huge project and completing the brief and also adding a lot more functionality within the app that the brief didn't require.

#### Challenges

* Was a challenge because of the scale of the project but I got all of the functionality in and also added a couple of golf courses for v1.0 to test.

### Reviews and Testing
The `Reviews and Testing` consists of `in class`, reviews.

#### Future Implementation

* Add `admin portal` to the app.
* Have companies `register` to host competitions.
* Improve static `scorecard`.
